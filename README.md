# 10-315-Fine-Wine
10-315 Intro to ML Final project at CMU, Spring 2023.

Fine Wine is a predictor for whether wine is of good or bad quality based on the wine's attibutes.

We used 2 models for this project:
  - logistic regression
  - nerual network
  
We also experimented with different layers and learning rates for our nerual network, yielding insightful results.
